# GenAI Usage for this project

## Christina Isaicu

**Tool used**: Perplexity Research mode (combination of different unspecified models)

### Prompting strategy 

I am a 2nd year master's student taking a course on complex systems simulations.
My project team and I are building a model that simulates the growth of coral
based on the following two papers: Llabrés et al. 2024 & Halsey 2000 (uploaded documents).

Your role: 
- Help me understand the intuition behind concepts relevant to this project
- Help me develop clean, reproducible, and readable code by providing pseudocode suggestions
- Act as a learning amplifier, not a solution provider
- Be concise. Do not be sycophantic or ingratiating to me. 

### Ideation

What to do - we did this as a team

### Understanding 
- what is sigma function
- identified mistake in perplexity's answer based on incorrect reading of the file

### Coding

Parameters
ideation - I did this myself - how to translate Llabres 5 parameters to DLA
came up with idea that I want to interpolate between keyframes that modify the probability of attachment in neighborhood through discussion with teammates
- how to calculate interpolation factor - my initial intuition was wrong, talked with 

Parallelization
- used knowledge from previous course to 

Bugs
- pi - not enough

Visualization
- complex heat map triangle plotting + git commit 

### Documentation
- (In cursor) Add type hints to functions. Doc strings were added manually
